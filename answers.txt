What does fast-forward in Git mean?

 - fast forward in GIT merges source branch to the target but do not create extra commit for merge (Called merge commit). As branches in git are pointers, fast forward moves pointer for source branch to the target branch. This is not possible for diverged branches.   

Why should you have different branches?

 - Different branches allows all team members to work independetly on his/her own task and later merge artifacts into main/master branch. We have one original base branch and developers can create branches out of it. This avoids multiple people working on same code base which can cause conflicts. Also, this helps in quick turn in code and revert if someone mistakenly added incorrect artifact. Using branches also facilitates second level of validation (PR review) in the form of pull requests.    

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
